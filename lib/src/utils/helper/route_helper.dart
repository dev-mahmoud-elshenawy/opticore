/// A service that encapsulates navigation logic, making it easier to manage routing
/// within the application. This class provides methods to push, replace, and pop routes
/// on the navigation stack, as well as to remove routes based on certain conditions.
///
/// The `RouteHelper` class abstracts the complexity of navigation, providing a centralized
/// interface to manage app navigation actions programmatically. It integrates with the Flutter
/// navigation system and allows navigation operations to be triggered from anywhere in the app,
/// including non-widget classes, services, or BLoCs.
///
/// **Main Features:**
/// - Push and pop routes with both widget and named route options.
/// - Replace the current screen with a new screen or named route.
/// - Remove routes from the stack, allowing for a clean navigation experience.
/// - Control route stack operations programmatically, including managing the state of the navigation stack.
///
/// This class is intended to be used with a `BuildContext` for navigation within widget trees, but it also
/// includes a static `navigatorKey` to allow navigation control outside of the widget tree (e.g., from services).
///
/// ## Included Methods:
/// - [push]: Pushes a new screen onto the navigation stack.
/// - [pushNamed]: Pushes a new screen using a named route.
/// - [pushReplacement]: Replaces the current screen with a new screen.
/// - [pushReplacementNamed]: Replaces the current screen with a new named route.
/// - [pushAndRemoveUntil]: Pushes a new screen and removes all previous routes up to the provided path.
/// - [pushNamedAndRemoveUntil]: Pushes a new named route and removes all previous routes up to the provided path.
/// - [pop]: Pops the current route off the stack, optionally returning a result to the previous screen.
/// - [canPop]: Determines whether the current route can be popped from the navigation stack.
/// - [navigatorKey]: A global key to access the navigator state of the application.
/// - [previousRoute]: Holds the name of the previous route.
/// - [builder]: Default route settings for the navigator.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// RouteHelper(navigatorKey.currentContext).pushNamed('/home');
/// ```
class RouteHelper {
  final BuildContext context;

  /// A global key used to access the navigator state of the application.
  ///
  /// The `navigatorKey` allows for navigation actions outside the widget tree,
  /// such as navigating from a service, bloc, or any other non-widget class
  /// that needs to trigger navigation.
  ///
  /// This key is essential for managing navigation in apps that require
  /// control over the navigation stack from outside the widget hierarchy.
  /// It can be used for pushing routes, popping routes, and performing
  /// other navigation actions programmatically.
  ///
  /// Example usage:
  /// ```dart
  /// navigatorKey.currentState?.pushNamed('/someRoute');
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This global key is typically passed to the `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`
  /// widget through the `navigatorKey` property to manage navigation throughout
  /// the app.

  /// or when another route is pushed on top of them or popped from above them.
  ///
  /// It's used in conjunction with the RouteAware mixin to handle status bar
  /// and other UI state updates during navigation.
  ///
  /// Example usage:
  /// ```dart
  /// class MyScreen extends State<MyWidget> with RouteAware {
  ///   @override
  ///   void didChangeDependencies() {
  ///     super.didChangeDependencies();
  ///     RouteHelper.routeObserver.subscribe(this, ModalRoute.of(context)!);
  ///   }
  ///
  ///   @override

  ///     RouteHelper.routeObserver.unsubscribe(this);

  /// **Example:**
  /// ```dart

  /// You can use this method to control the visibility or enablement of back buttons or other navigation controls.
  ///
  /// Returns `true` if there is a route to pop; otherwise, it returns `false`.
  ///
  /// **Example:**
  /// ```dart
  /// if (RouteHelper(context).canPop()) {
